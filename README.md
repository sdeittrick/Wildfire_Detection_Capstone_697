# Wildfire_Detection_Capstone_697

## Introduction 
On the West Coast of the US, we see large-scale droughts and now extremely lengthy fire seasons. Many people are displaced every year, and towns and acres of tree cover are destroyed. Right now, geographic communities in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) are pushing for human-monitored camera systems to detect forest fires. This repository creates and end to end pipline utilizing a CNN model to identify fires from video's and pictures.

## UE5 Documentation Description
Due to the lack of available high quality pictures available we utlize the Unreal Engine (UE4 & UE5) to generate real-life relief maps, adding trees, and simulating forest fires to train our model. [Insert pictures/go into more detail here]. 

## Corsican Database 
To test the performance of our model we have utilized the Corsican Wildfire Database from _"Computer vision for wildfire research: an evolving image dataset for processing and analysis‚Äù_ which is one of the largest of its kind. This database exclusively contained images including fire, thus we sought images without fire from other locations [Insert more detail here on the website access etc.]
